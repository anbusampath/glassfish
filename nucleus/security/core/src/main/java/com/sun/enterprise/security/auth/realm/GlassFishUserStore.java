/**
 * Implementations of this interface provide access to Get user data useful for authentication purposes.

 * A user store has a strong connection with the concept of an identity store. In GlassFish the identity store concept
 * (validating caller credentials and returning user data) is split into multiple artifacts. The identity store itself
 * is provided by the <code>LoginModule</code>, of which an implementation can use the <code>GlassFishUserStore</code>
 * if needed (but will typically need to use functionality beyond this interface as well).
 *
 * <p>
 * GlassFish provides an extra interface to optionally Add, Update or Remove user data (via the admin console of GlassFish) via
 * the {@link GlassFishUserManagement} interface. This one is however rarely implemented, as most systems behind the user store (like
 * LDAP and Database) have their own UI for this.
