## Eclipse GlassFish 7.x

GlassFish 7.0.8 is a final release, containing final Jakarta EE 10 APIs. It compiles and runs on JDK 11 to JDK 21ea33. MicroProfile support requires JDK 17 or higher.

This release prepares GlassFish for the upcoming JDK 21; it compiles and passes all internal tests using OpenJDK 21ea35. Several TCKs passed on JDK 21 as well, but the TCK as a whole is not JDK 21 compatible yet. 

This release fixes multi-jar compatibility in GlassFish and does further preparations for JDK 21. It includes various component updates among which those for CDI, Faces, and JSON. Test coverage is improved by adding the TCKs for REST Client and Connectors. Finally, various CDI extensions have been optimised to reduce excessive and unnecessary calls to them.
